[Here the theory community will present a discussion of how particles obtain LHC-detector-visible (and beyond) lifetimes in BSM models and describe curated classes of models (including exhaustive citations) that highlight the ways in which the lifetime frontier is an ideal place where new physics could be hiding.

It is suggested that the theory motivation be organized according to {\bf LLP production modes}:~Higgs or other SM particle decays, direct production through SM gauge interactions (SUSY-like), Hidden Valley, \ldots

Then each of the experiments will contribute a discussion of why LLP searches are challenging and require non-standard methods.]

Figure~\ref{fig:ATLASCalRatio1} comes from an ATLAS search~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-103}.
