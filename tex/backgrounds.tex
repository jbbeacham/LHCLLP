LLP searches many unusual backgrounds, including irreducible contributions from long-lived SM particle decays (particularly heavy-flavor mesons), random track crossings, beam-gas collisions, out-of-time pile-up, beam halo, cosmics, cavern backgrounds, etc.

The goal of this section is to collate this information and (if possible) provide recommendations for measuring and estimating the most common backgrounds. This will also give theorists a good idea of what backgrounds should be kept in mind when proposing new analysis methods, even though many cannot be accurately simulated.
