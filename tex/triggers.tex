\section{Summary of Current Trigger Sensitivity \& Proposals}
Summary from Trigger WG specifying where the current triggers have coverage, and list proposals for hadronic seed for displaced jet trigger. Also highlight high-multiplicity, low-threshold lepton triggers that are useful for low-mass LLPs.

\section{Prospects for Trigger Upgrades}
FTK, L1 track trigger (``stubs''), LHCb online reconstruction, timing layer

\section{Prospects for Offline Reconstruction with Detector Upgrades}
Timing layer, HGcal, other upgrades?

\section{Current and Proposed Dedicated LLP Detectors}

Limit to 1-1.5 pages each, focus on projected sensitivity and complementarity
