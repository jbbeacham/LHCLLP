%\section{Summary of Current Trigger Sensitivity \& Proposals}
%Summary from Trigger WG specifying where the current triggers have coverage, and list proposals for hadronic seed for displaced jet trigger. Also highlight high-multiplicity, low-threshold lepton triggers that are useful for low-mass LLPs.
