Proposed layout for each signature:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the experimental signature?
\item Reference to relevant theory section simplified models, and provide models that give rise to signature (are there associated objects?, provide citations)
\item What searches have currently been done?
\item What are the experimental challenges associated with the signature, including:~trigger \& reconstruction limitations, presence of $\slashed{E}_{\rm T}$ in decays in reconstructing LLP, primary expected backgrounds, prospects for improvement
\item Projection for recommended simplified model
\end{enumerate}

\section{Decay of a Single LLP In Detector}

The location in parentheses denotes {\bf location} of LLP decay. For single LLP, may especially need to consider associated production channels to improve sensitivity! Include in discussion of sections below.

\subsection{Displaced Lepton Pair (tracker)}

At least one search exists

Includes LHCb searches in $B$ decays, such as $B\rightarrow K^* X,\,X\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$

\subsection{Displaced lepton jet (tracker + muon system)}

At least one search exists (??)

\subsection{Displaced tau(s) (tracker)}

\subsection{Displaced jet pair (tracker)}

At least one search exists

Need to separately consider $b$ jets?


\subsection{Displaced lepton + multi-tracks (tracker)}

At least one search exists

\subsection{Displaced multi-tracks (tracker)}

At least one search exists

\subsection{Displaced tracks (muon system)}

\subsection{Single slow, non-pointing photon (tracker)}

\subsection{Displaced, late calo hits (\emph{e.g.,} decay in calo, no tracks, CalRatio)}

\subsection{Out-of-time calo hit (\emph{e.g.,} stopped gluino)}

At least one search exists

\section{Decay of Two LLPs In Detector}

\subsection{Two displaced jets (tracker)}

At least one search exists; should quantify when this is useful relative to single-jet-pair analysis (\emph{i.e.,} low mass)

\subsection{Two displaced jets (muon spectrometer)}

At least one search exists

\subsection{Two displaced multi-track vertices (tracker)}
Probably low-mass is most interesting here

\subsection{Two displaced lepton jets (tracker + muon spectrometer)}
At least one search exists

\subsection{Two slow, non-pointing photons (decay before ECAL)}
At least one search exists

\subsection{Two large impact-parameter leptons (tracker)}
At least one search exists

\subsection{Two large impact-parameter taus (tracker)}

\section{Decay of Multiple LLPs in Detector}

\subsection{Emerging Jet Topology}
Many low-mass vertices in a jet-like object

\subsection{Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns (SUEP}
Fakes underlying event/pile-up

\section{Exotic Track Signatures}

\subsection{Heavy Stable Charged (Electric or Magnetic) Tracks}
At least one search exists
Should we split this into more ``signature-driven'' categories (based on individual track properties)? I will leave it for track experts to decide

\subsection{Very Low Ionization Tracks}

Milli-charged particles

\subsection{Quirky Tracks}
Quirk pairs lead to straight, highly ionizing tracks (so look very different from conventional tracks)
Tracks that bend against magnetic field

\subsection{Disappearing Tracks}
At least one search exists

\subsection{Kinked Tracks}

\subsection{Heavy, Stable, Hadronized Particle Signatures}
Signatures of new, heavy particles with color charge that hadronize and pass through detector (look for charge flipping)
Maybe split up by signature as with tracks?

\subsection{Tracks with Unusual Mass}
Measure mass using RICH systems

\subsection{Tracks With Unusual Time of Flight}
Heavy particles where sub-detector hits are out-of-time

\subsection{Other ideas?}
It has been suggested that this section lacks in details relative to others. Please encourage experts to contribute!

\section{Auxiliary Detectors}

This section focuses on proposed or existing auxiliary detectors to look for long-lived particles emerging from the collision point. While the focus of the main document is on ATLAS/CMS/LHCb, the discussion here focuses on the complementarity of these detectors.

\subsection{MOEDAL}

\subsection{MilliQan}

\subsection{MATHUSLA}

\subsection{ATLAS/CMS Beampipe Stuck Monopole Search}
