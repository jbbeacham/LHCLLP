Proposed layout for each signature:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the experimental signature?
\item Reference to relevant theory section simplified models, and provide models that give rise to signature (are there associated objects?, provide citations)
\item What searches have currently been done?
\item What are the experimental challenges associated with the signature, including:~trigger \& reconstruction limitations, presence of $\slashed{E}_{\rm T}$ in decays in reconstructing LLP, primary expected backgrounds, prospects for improvement
\item Projection for recommended simplified model
\end{enumerate}

\section{Decay of a Single LLP In Detector}

The location in parentheses denotes {\bf location} of LLP decay. For single LLP, may especially need to consider associated production channels to improve sensitivity! Include in discussion of sections below.

\subsection{Displaced Lepton Pair (tracker)}

At least one search exists

Includes LHCb searches in $B$ decays, such as $B\rightarrow K^* X,\,X\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$

\subsection{Displaced lepton jet (tracker + muon system)}

At least one search exists (??)

\subsection{Displaced tau(s) (tracker)}

\subsection{Displaced jet pair (tracker)}

At least one search exists

Need to separately consider $b$ jets?


\subsection{Displaced lepton + multi-tracks (tracker)}

At least one search exists

\subsection{Displaced multi-tracks (tracker)}

At least one search exists

\subsection{Displaced tracks (muon system)}

\subsection{Slow, non-pointing photon (tracker)}

\subsection{Displaced, late calo hits (\emph{e.g.,} decay in calo, no tracks, CalRatio)}

\subsection{Out-of-time calo hit (\emph{e.g.,} stopped gluino)}

At least one search exists
