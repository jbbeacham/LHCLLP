Put introduction to the long-lived particle search program at the LHC. Brief overview of theory motivation (on a general level, with citation dumps) as well as the general challenges and opportunities of experimental searches for LLPs (again, broad brush with lots of citations).

\section{Goals of the White Paper}

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of work on LLP both on the theory and experiment side. This is due to the success of experimental techniques to reconstruct LLPs in earlier runs of the LHC and the theoretical development of well-motivated models that give rise to a range of LLP signatures. It is also in part due to the lack of positive signals of new particles in other, more conventional LHC searches, giving heightened urgency and importance in the coverage of LLP signatures.

To this end, the document serves to assess the current status of LLP searches at the LHC, determining where searches currently have good coverage of LLP searches and where there can be improvements. It also evaluates the impact of possible new triggers or upgrades on the performance of LLP searches in advance of the final decisions for Phase 2 upgrades. Finally, it provides recommendations for the presentation of search results to broaden the impact of existing and planned searches, and to chart a course for the near-future development of the program.

More concretely,
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item We develop a minimal (but expandable) simplified models framework for the LLP program that incorporates the best-motivated LLP theories and models
\item We use the simplified models framework to assess the sensitivity of current searches and identify the highest priority gaps in coverage
\item These in turn inform the development of triggers and decisions about upgrade technologies, and we summarize the impact of possible new upgrades (including existing and planned dedicated detectors such as Moedal, MilliQan, MATHUSLA, \dots)
\item Provide a summary of recommendations for the presentation of new LLP searches
\item Identify the new frontiers of LLP searches in which more research and development is needed, particularly in the area of high-multiplicity LLP searches (dark showers)
\end{enumerate}
