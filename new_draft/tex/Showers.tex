A short section (3-5 pages?) outlining how dark showers don't easily fall into existing simplified models or experimental search programs. Give a few examples of specific models (emerging jets model, 1-2 others) as well as some concrete experimental methods being used now. This should motivate and lead into the work of the Dark Showers WG, although if they have concrete results by the time the white paper goes out we can include those.
