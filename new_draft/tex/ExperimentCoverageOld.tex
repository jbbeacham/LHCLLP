{\bf [BS:~I think we should start with a short list of the most pressing ``gaps'', and then show the more comprehensive mapping of existing searches into the simplified models parameter space}

\section{Summary of High-Priority Searches Needed}

\section{Sensitivity of Current Searches to Simplified Models}

{\bf [BS:~My proposal is to organize according to channel (all-hadronic, semi-leptonic, leptonic, photons, etc). It may be that some searches have sensitivity to many (for example, ATLAS/CMS displaced jets is also sensitive to electrons, photons, etc) but I can't think of a better way of doing it]}

\section{Overview of Gaps}

Here is where we synthesize the information of the last section, identifying the gaps, and then pick 5-10 that go into the first section.
